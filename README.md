static-web-cluster
==================

Implementation of the Node Web Cluster for static websites.


### Introduction

Based on the [Node Web Cluster](https://github.com/luiseduardobrito/node-web-cluster), this project supports a static website, serving it with the server structure created in the cluster.

Recommended for scalable static websites, with built-in client framework for client-modularization as specified in the [Client Documentation](https://github.com/luiseduardobrito/node-web-cluster/wiki/Client).

### How to use

Put all your static stuff in the ```static/``` folder, such as HTML, CSS and image files. The JS files should be put in the ```client/``` folder.

### Guides
